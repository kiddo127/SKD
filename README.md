This repository contains the official implementation of Stratified Knowledge-Density Super-Network for Scalable Vision Transformers (AAAI 2026), a novel approach for building scalable Vision Transformers (ViTs) that enable efficient sub-network extraction for diverse deployment scenarios.

## 📖 Overview
Traditional approaches require training and maintaining multiple ViT variants for different resource constraints, which is computationally expensive and inefficient. Our method transforms a pre-trained ViT into a Stratified Knowledge-Density Super-Network, where knowledge is hierarchically organized across weights, allowing flexible extraction of sub-networks that retain maximal knowledge for varying model sizes.

- 🔧 Easy Deployment: Support for diverse resource constraints from edge devices to servers

## 🏗️ Method
### Weighted PCA for Attention Contraction (WPAC)
WPAC concentrates knowledge into a compact set of critical weights through function-preserving transformations:
